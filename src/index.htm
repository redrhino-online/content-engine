                            value: `Prompt for Instagram Carousel Post Creation:

You are tasked with creating a highly engaging Instagram carousel post series that dives deep into an emotional, relational, or personal growth topic. The tone should be empathetic, insightful, and empowering. Your audience craves connection, authenticity, and the wisdom that helps them grow emotionally and spiritually. They are familiar with the deeper emotional dynamics between men and women, and they want to explore complex, healing-based topics that resonate with their experiences.

The goal is to create a series of messages in the tone of a trusted friend, that concludes by informing the reader of my "7-Day Conscious Love Challenge" and invites engagement, asking readers to leave a specific comment "CHALLENGE" for more information. 

THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM AND THE COMMENT TRIGGER NEED TO MATCH EXACTLY DO NOT CHANGE THEM AT ALL.

Start with a general observation of a symptom related to the topic through the lens of emotional healing, then take the reader on a journey of self-discovery or relational insights, and end with a call to action (CTA) that invites them to join the challenge.

Each slide is written in the third person perspective of women or the feminine nature, exactly three sentences in paragraph form. Limited to a 8th grade reading level.

If a topic is addressing men, it should be as advise to women to support, communicate, or connect with their men. THE AUDIENCE IS EXCLUSIVELY WOMEN.

### Structure for Response Format (10-slide carousel):

1. Provocation of Problem (Slide 1):
- Provoke introspection related to the topic by declaring a statement of observation related to internal state.
- Example: *“Many women feel like relationships lose their spark even when both partners care deeply.”*

2. Acknowledging the Problem (Slide 2):
- Describe the emotional or relational issue clearly.
- Example: *“It’s not about love fading. It’s about disconnection, routines, and unhealed wounds keeping us apart.”*

3. Exploring the Underlying Causes (Slide 3):
- Introduce the root causes, focusing on the relational dynamics between the feminine and masculine.
- Example: *“Often, women seek emotional depth, while men focus on external needs. This mismatch creates tension, not intimacy.”*

4. Feminine Perspective (Slide 4):
- Dive deeper into the emotional needs and journey of the feminine, using a compassionate tone.
- Example: *“The feminine craves depth, safety, and emotional presence. When she doesn’t get this, she feels unseen and unheard.”*

5. Masculine Perspective (Slide 5):
- Offer insights into the masculine journey, framing it in a way that creates understanding and empathy.
- Example: *“The masculine, on the other hand, is wired to protect and provide. He may feel like he’s doing his part, but emotional presence is where the gap lies.”*

6. Identify the Breakdown (Slide 6):
- Explain how the misalignment in these needs leads to relational struggles.
- Example: *“When both partners focus only on what’s missing, intimacy dies, and the relationship begins to feel like a transactional exchange.”*

7. Solution (Slide 7):
- Offer an actionable insight or solution, focusing on healing or growth.
- Example: *“The way forward is through mutual vulnerability. The feminine leads with her heart, and the masculine follows with his presence.”*

8. Empowerment for Women (Slide 8):
- Speak directly to the feminine, empowering her to reclaim her truth and boundaries.
- Example: *“Ladies, your softness is a gift—but only when shared with someone who makes you feel safe. You deserve a love that honors your worth.”*

9. Call to Action (Slide 9):
- End with a CTA that informs the reader of a solution my "7-Day Conscious Love Challenge" and invites engagement as an extension of the slide contents, asking readers to comment "CHALLENGE" for more information. THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM AND THE COMMENT TRIGGER NEED TO MATCH EXACTLY DO NOT CHANGE THEM AT ALL.
- Example: *“Im leading a 7-Day Conscious Love Challenge where I will guide you in the essential healing practices that empower the feminine and deepen the masculine allowing you to continually open yourself in partnership and create conscious love. Drop the word CHALLENGE in the comments and I'l send you the details.”*

10. Encouragement and reiterating call to action.
- optional steps should add additional context to the call to action through encouragement and hope.
